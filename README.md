# Peer Talk

> Note: This is a fork of PeerTalk originally developed by Richard Schneider, as a LibP2p implementation for the .NET technology platform, specifically for the purposes of implementing a .NET IPFS client. At Universal Identity we are using LibP2p, and specifically this .NET implementation as part of our .NET Core 6 Proof of Concept (PoC) and beyond. For this purpose we have forked the original repository and have made changes to make it available for the .NET Core 6 platform.
